\textbf{Project}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Inventory Mapping} \\
		\textit{(28 August 2017 - Present)}\\
			Backend service development for the Amazon retail website and item fulfillment infrustructure. During my time in the Inventory Mapping team I decreased system data caching time from ~15 minutes to less than 7 minutes for partial updates and from ~36 hours to less than 15 hours for a full data refresh. I assisted in re-writing and designing a new system to migrate off of SQL with Oracle to Amazons no-SQL DynamoDB database. This process included designing precomputational systems and uniqueness enforcement with DynamoDB transactionality within the no-SQL database, DynamoDB, which ensures data quility and speed of the services responses. \\
			This re-write included a change of language from Java to kotlin, during which time I designed and implemented Logging, Metrics and Caching libraries in Kotlin, which is now used by multiple internal Amazon teams.\\

\enclosure[Attached]{curriculum vit\ae{}}
\makelettertitle

I am an enthusiastic programmer that particularly enjoys graphics programming and data visualisation. I am highly dedicated and disciplined thanks to my Karate training, of which I trained for over 12 years.

I have a British Passport, and have nothing against having to travel or immegrate.

Out of all the projects I have participated in, I enjoyed those where I designed graphical visualisations for data, and the projects where I created the graphical sections for games.

I have a degree in Computer Games Design and have worked on multiple games in the past few years, using tools such as Microsoft XNA, LibGDX and Unity. My Games Design Degree has taught me OpenGL and GLSL.  

I have taken Networking, Cryptography, Linear Algebra, Interface Design and User Experience courses at UCT and have many projects on my website: \url{http://people.cs.uct.ac.za/\textasciitilde btalbot}\\and Github page:\\ \url{https://github.com/DarkJaguar91}.
