\makelettertitle

I am an enthusiastic programmer that particularly enjoys graphics programming and data visualisation. I am highly dedicated and disciplined thanks to my Karate training, of which I trained for over 12 years.

I have a British Passport, and have nothing against having to travel or immegrate.

Out of all the projects I have participated in, I enjoyed those where I designed graphical visualisations for data, and the projects where I created the graphical sections for games.

I have a degree in Computer Games Design and have worked on multiple games in the past few years, using tools such as Microsoft XNA, LibGDX and Unity. My Games Design Degree has taught me OpenGL and GLSL.  

I have taken Networking, Cryptography, Linear Algebra, and Interface Design courses at UCT and have many projects on my website: \url{http://people.cs.uct.ac.za/\textasciitilde btalbot} and Github page: \url{https://github.com/DarkJaguar91}.
